#Hack North Campus

Overview: Provide North Campus with a neat technology hack along the lines of the Beyster Lights.

##Giant Arcade

###Details
* Utilize an already existing grid-like structure on North Campus
  * Minimum number of pixels: 16x16
    * Do we need to make it square?
    * Lots of long hallways
    * 32x20 grid -> 16:10 ratio, very nice
    * Multiple LEDs for each pixel, separated by panels
  * Diffusing panels with lights?
    * Make sure that the lights aren't distractingly bright, but still visible
* Build up a server that will run and people can hook in to
  * Raspberry Pi controlling all of the lights
  * People can write their own JS applets using the API that'll display things
  * Keep a gallery of user-submitted applets, potentially let people vote on them

####Applet Ideas
* Pong
* Snake
* Game of Life
* Tron
* Breakout
* Pac-man if multi-coloured
* Flipbook
* Drawings

###Logistics
* Campus Contact: TBD
* Where?
  * Potential: side of BBB to the right of the main entrance
  * Server room of BBB
* How do we get the light-grid up?
* Budget/Parts List
  * 1000 RGB LEDs -> $360
  * Polycarb panels for LEDs -> $15 for 6"x6"
    * http://www.mcmaster.com/#standard-plastic-sheets/=w8okt6
  * PCBs -> $350 for all
    * 1 for every 4 boards
  * Overall, looking at $1000
